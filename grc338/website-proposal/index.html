            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            
            <p>Beautiful Blossoms</p>
            
            <p>We are a small local flower shop in the San Luis Obispo area. Our flowers are perfect for everyday occasions, and we sell flowers by the stem. We are the perfect come and go shop for your everyday needs.  Our mission is to make days brighter and happier, one flower at a time! </p>
            
            <h2>Target audience</h2>
            
            <p>We have noticed that most flower shops in general sell custom created bouquets that need to be ordered days and even weeks in advance. Although we do have the capability to create custom jobs like that, our primary products are locally grown flowers that are sold by the stem. Therefore, our target audience are middle class individuals who tend to buy flowers. 
            </p>
           
            <p> We are marketing our flowers to be inexpensive and affordable to anyone for any event. Whether it be college students looking to brighten a friend's day or a mother looking for flowers to bring to their daughter’s dance recital – Beautiful Blossoms has exactly what you need!</p>
