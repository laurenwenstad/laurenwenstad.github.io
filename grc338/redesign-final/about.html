        <h2> Gino's Pizza</h2>
        <p>Gino's Pizza is your neighborhood family Pizzeria where you can gather with your friends, family, or co-workers and enjoy traditional Italian recipes made with the freshest ingredients. At Gino's Pizza we believe that pizza is one of, if not the only, heart-warming, mood soothing, create a party ambiance anywhere/anytime, comfort foods. Whether it is sunny, or cloudy outside, morning or night, pizza always has a way of lifting the spirits, and making things, well, PERFECT! It is because of our belief that we take great pride in every aspect of making our pizza. From the kneading of our dough for the most amazing crust. To applying just the right amount of natural cheese to make every bite stringy. At Gino's Pizza we love making Pizza. We love eating Pizza. And we love sharing our passion for pizza with everyone.

        Gino's Pizza has been sharing its love for Pizza with families in Buellton and the 5-Cities area for years, and now we are coming to San Luis Obispo. Our new location at 1761 Monterey Street (where Grand Avenue meets Monterey St.), puts us in the perfect position to serve Cal Poly students, families from the surounding neighborhoods, hotel guests, and the rest of San Luis Obispo. </p>
