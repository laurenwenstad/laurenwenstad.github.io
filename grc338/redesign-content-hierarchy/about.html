        <h2> Gino's Pizza</h2>
        <p>Gino's Pizza is your neighborhood family Pizzeria where you can gather with your friends, family, or co-workers and enjoy traditional Italian recipes made with the freshest ingredients. At Gino's Pizza we believe that pizza is one of, if not the only, heart-warming, mood soothing, create a party ambiance anywhere/anytime, comfort foods. Whether it is sunny, or cloudy outside, morning or night, pizza always has a way of lifting the spirits, and making things, well, PERFECT! It is because of our belief that we take great pride in every aspect of making our pizza. From the kneading of our dough for the most amazing crust. To applying just the right amount of natural cheese to make every bite stringy. At Gino's Pizza we love making Pizza. We love eating Pizza. And we love sharing our passion for pizza with everyone.
